# OpenCart-manualTesting
OpenCart is free open source e-commerce platform for online merchants.
OpenCart provides a professional and reliable foundation from which to build a
successful online store. This foundation appeals to a wide variety of users;
ranging from seasoned web developers looking for a user-friendly interface to
use, to shop owners just launching their business online for the first time.
OpenCart has an extensive amount of features that gives you a strong hold over
the customization of your store. With OpenCart's tools, you can help your online
shop live up to its fullest potential.


**Opencart Frontend**
This Document is intended to be used as an introduction to the OpenCart default
store front. The store front reveals how the customer views and interacts with
the store.



The products seen above are included as sample data with the OpenCart
installation. These products can easily be removed and replaced with the
shop's products later.



**Navigating the shop**
The OpenCart default theme makes navigating a shop's products easily
accessible to its customers.

**Home page**
The home page is arguably the most important page in the shop, in terms
of presentation. In most cases, this will be the first page that a customer
interacts with (especially if they are directed to the store site from a
search engine). The shop's homepage needs to be user-friendly, while at
the same time highlighting the shop's products.
The first step in becoming familiar with the store front is understanding
the anatomy of the OpenCart default homepage.
The header
The header will be displayed at the top of the page, on every page of the
store; not just the home page.

**The header has the following navigation options:**
â€¢ Store logo: Clicking on this logo will direct the customer back to the
home page of the store.
â€¢ Currency block: The customer can select which currency the store's
products will be in by clicking on any of the currency icons.
â€¢ Shopping Cart: Displays the number of items purchased, and the
total price of the order. Clicking on the button will containing all of
products added to the cart and an option to "View Cart" or
"Checkout".
â€¢ Search box: The customers can type in the search box to search for
a product within the store's product categories.
â€¢ Links: Links the customer to the Home page, Wish List, My Account,
Shopping Cart, and Checkout.
â€¢ Telephone: Company telephone number.
â€¢ My Account: Customer can register or login from here.
The top menu
The top menu category only displays the top parent categories of
products.



Like the header, the top menu will be displayed on every page. When the
customer's mouse is dragged over a category, a drop-down menu will
display the sub-categories for that parent category.

When a parent category is clicked, the customer will be directed to the
category page, which displays all the products within that category.
Slideshow
The slideshow displays several product banners of your choice by
alternating the images in a slideshow. After a certain amount of time, one
banner will shift to the the next banner. Banners in this slideshow are
useful for highlighting certain products to be easily accessible by the
customer. When the banner is clicked on, the customer will be directed to
the product on the banner's page.

Unlike the top menu and header, the slideshow in the OpenCart default
can only be viewed on the home page in this position.
Featured products
OpenCart gives you the option of featuring specific products of their
choosing on the home page.


The Featured section includes the product image, name, price and an
option to add the product directly to the Shopping Cart.
The carousel is only located on the Home Page in the default.
Footer
The footer is located at the bottom of every page, not just the Home
Page. This block of miscellaneous links is useful in sorting relevant pages
for the customer that may not logically sort anywhere else.
The organizational scheme of the footer can be divided into the following
sections:
â€¢ Information: "About Us", "Delivery Information", "Privacy Policy",
"Terms & Conditions"
â€¢ Customer Service: "Contact Us", "Returns", "Site Map"
â€¢ Extras: "Brands", "Gift Vouchers", "Affiliates", "Specials"
â€¢ My Account: "My Account", "Order History", "Wish List",
"Newsletter"

**Product pages**
The OpenCart default product page will follow the structural format seen
below.

The product page can be divided into the following sections:
â€¢ Product image: The product image can be displayed under the
title on the left-side, along with alternate views of the product
underneath it in smaller box. Clicking on the main image will
expand the image within the window for the customer to see it in
greater detail.
â€¢ Product details: The product code, availability, and price are
displayed just right to the product image.
â€¢ Cart: The customer can select a quantity and add the product to
their cart, wish list, or compare.
â€¢ Rating/Sharing: Underneath the cart can rate the product and/or
share the product on different social media websites.
â€¢ Description tab: An area underneath the main product information
to provide a detailed description of the product.
â€¢ Review tab: An area for the customer to write a review on the
product.

**Category product listings**


Category product listings enable customers to browse products similar to
other products within the same category. This is especially helpful for
customers looking to compare products, a feature that will be explained
under Categories. The category page can be accessed a number of ways.
It can be accessed from the top menu, when a customer clicks on one of
the parent categories. Also, on product pages a customer can access the
category product listing page by clicking on a category on the left side
category block.

As seen above, the category block is displayed on the left-side like it is in
the product page. There is space under the Category title at the top to

add a description to the category. The "Refine Search" links to sub-
categories of that category for the user to browse. The products can be

displayed according to the customer's preference: in a list or grid. The
above image is sorted in the listing format. The products can be sorted
according to name, price, rating, or model in the "Sort By" box. The



number of products displayed in the product listing can be changed in
"Show" from 15 up to 100.
There is a section that gives space for each of the products within the
category, providing a product image, description, price, and an Add to
Cart option. There is an option to add the product to a wish list. Another
option for the product is to "Add to Compare".
Product compare
The "**Add to Compare**" feature in the product section allows the customer
to compare the different specifications, features, and price of a number of
products s/he might be interested in.

The customer is given the option to add one of the compared products to
the cart if they want to. Pressing "Continue" will bring the user back to
the home page.

**Shopping Cart page**
Once a customer adds a product to the cart, they can access the shopping
cart in the header under "Shopping Cart".



The shopping cart gives an overview of the product selected by including
the categories "Image", "Product Name", "Model", "Quantity", "Unit
Price", and "Total". The customer has an option to add a coupon code or
gift voucher, or estimate shipping & taxes, before heading to the
checkout. The "Continue Shopping" button links back to the homepage.
Creating an account
Before a customer can continue checking out a product from the shopping
cart, the customer needs to select either guest checkout or log into their
account. The guest checkout doesn't require log-in details. Returning
customers may want to make an account with the store.
There are a few ways a customer can make an account:


**1. Checkout**

Step 1 of the check out process allows the user to make an account
before continuing with payment. Selecting "Register Account" will
change Step 2 of checkout from Billing to Account & Billing details.
Account & Billing asks for the same personal details as Billing,
except that it asks for the user to create a password for their
account. After Step 2 is completed, the customer may continue with
the checkout process.

**2. Header- "My Account"**

Clicking "My Account" in the header will show the option for
customer to the Login or create account. This page gives the
customer an option to log in if they already have an account, or
create a new account. In the "New Customer" section the customer
can click "Continue" under Register Account to be directed to the
"Register an Account" page.

**
Checkout**
Once a product has been added to the cart, the customer can continue to
the checkout to make their product purchase. The Checkout page can be
accessed in the header section of every page (found under the search
box). Customer checkout using OpenCart is a simple process that can be
completed in 6 steps.

**Step 1: Checkout options**
The customer can log into or register their account (as explained
above), or select guest checkout.

**Step 2: Billing details**
Personal details including "First Name", "Last Name", "E-mail", and
"Telephone" are filled into a form. It also requires the customer's
address details.

**Step 3: Delivery details**
In Billing Details, the user can check a box to indicate that the
delivery details and billing details are the same. This will cause it to
skip over this step to Delivery Method. If the delivery details are
different from the billing details the customer can enter this
information in a form in this section.

** Step 4: Delivery method**
A method of shipping is selected here. A comment box is added for
the customer to add comments about their order.

**Step 5: Payment method**
The customer selects their method of payment here and may add
comments in the comment box.

**Step 6: Confirm order**
In this last step, the customer will see an overview of their
purchase; including the product description, quantity, and price
(with tax & shipping).
